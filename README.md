# Learn-Python

A collection of Python fundamentals for my students. Instead of following a step-by-step guide, the goal is to work on projects while simultaneously understanding various topics covered in the corresponding .py files.

This repository can be used by anyone for their own learning and teaching purposes. If you find any errors or would like to add information, you are very welcome to improve the repository.

# Usage

* Clone or download the repository.
* Open [helloworld.py](https://github.com/mschaecke/Learn-Python/blob/main/learn-python/helloworld.py) in the "learn-python" directory.
* Work on your own projects alongside.
* Ask questions.
