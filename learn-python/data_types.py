# Variables store different types of data (information)
# Data types (including primitive types) are classes in Python
# When a value is assigned to a variable, Python automatically sets the correct
# data type

# The data type can be checked via the type() function

variable = "Hello World!"

print(variable)
print(type(variable))

variable = 1

print(variable)
print(type(variable))

# Alternatively, the data type can be specified via constructor functions
# (referred to as casting)
# The constructor functions are shown below each data type

# The following data types will be elaborated in their respective .py files:
#   * Strings (strings.py)
#   * Numbers (numbers.py)
