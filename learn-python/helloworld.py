# Python is a general-purpose programming language

# It offers the following advantages (or disadvantages) compared to other
# programming languages:
#   * high-level
#   * interpreted (instead of compiled)
#   * multiple programming paradigms (e.g. object-oriented, functional)
#   * emphasizes readability (similar to the English language)
#   * uses indentation (instead of brackets)
#   * dynamically-typed (type checking at runtime)
#   * garbage collection (instead of manual memory management)
#   * extensive standard library

# If you do not understand these terms, you will still be able to use this
# introduction to learn Python
# We will start with a very simple "Hello World!"

# You can open a terminal and type "python3" (or "py")
# to run Python as a command line
# OR
# open a terminal at a directory with .py files
# and run them via "python3 <file name>"

# Try this code:

print("Hello World!")

# print() is also used to create a blank line
# (invisible newline character or '\n')

print()
print("How are you?")

# Read the other .py files to learn the different topics
# "comments.py" and "variables.py" are both good starting points
