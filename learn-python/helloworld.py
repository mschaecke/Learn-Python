# You can open a terminal and type "python3" (or "py")
# to run Python as a command line
# OR
# open a terminal at a directory with .py files
# and run them via "python3 <file name>"

# Try this code:

print("Hello World!")

#
# It is also used to create a blank line
# (invisible newline character or '\n')
